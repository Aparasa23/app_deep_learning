    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python has become a common language for machine learning research and is the primary language for PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a significant revision of the language that is not entirely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. This course makes use of Python 3. Furthermore, many machine learning libraries are no longer compatible with versions of Python earlier than 3. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation (PSF), manages and directs resources for Python development. On January 1, 2020, the PSF discontinued the Python 2 language and no longer provides security patches and other improvements. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.\n",
