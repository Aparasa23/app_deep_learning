    "For this assignment, you will use an LSTM to predict a time series contained in the data file **[series-31-num.csv](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/datasets/series-31-num.csv)**.  The code that you will use to complete this will be similar to the sunspots example from the course module.  This data set contains two columns: *time* and *value*.  Create an LSTM network and train it with a sequence size of 5 and a prediction window of 1.  If you use a different sequence size, you will not have the correct number of submission rows. Train the neural network, the data set is relatively simple, and you should easily be able to get an RMSE below 1.0.  FYI, I generate this dataset by fitting a cubic spline to a series of random points. \n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains a time series data set, do not randomize the order of the rows!  For your training data, use all *time* values less than 3000, and for the test, use the remaining amounts greater than or equal to 3000. For the submit file, please send me the results of your test evaluation.  You should have two columns: *time* and *value*.  The column *time* should be the time at the beginning of each predicted sequence. The *value* should be the next value that your neural network predicted for each of the sequences.\n",
